<h1>How to use github by a github Amateur</h1>
<h2>By Paige Livingston</h2>
<p>Even though I had to get a ton of help from Dr. Sherman, i will be teaching you the steps to make a git hub repository and website.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Git Hub Account</li>
	<li>Terminal</li>
	<li>Sublime Text</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a repository</h2>
<p>In your github account, you want to click in the top left the green new button. This will allow you to create your reporitory. When your click the new button, github will ask you to name your repository. <b>MAKE SURE ITS PUBLIC.</b> After you name the repository you will click the create repository button and type in all of the information listed to you. To keep your sanity, make sure you type in everything word by word.</p>
<h2>Terminal and github</h2>
<ol>
	<li>open terminal and type next to your comupters user name cd and then drag your folder file into termainl. Once it is beside the cd then click enter.</li>
	<li>Type in echo "# (YOUR FOLDER NAME)" >> README.md then click enter</li>
	<li>Type git innit</li>
	<li>Type git commit -m "first commit" and hit enter</li>
	<li>Type git remote add origin with the HTTPS address listed and hit enter</li>
	<li>The final step to type is git push -u origin master</li>
</ol>
<p><b>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HIT ENTER</b></p>
<h2>The final steps</h2>
<p>When typing in sublime text, make sure you save with command S. When you save with command S then go to Terminal and type in these steps.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Type git add, you can either add a period after it or name the file you are changing</li>
	<li>Hit enter and type git commit -am "YOUR MESSAGE HERE", obviously do not type your message here, just add a message of what you are adding or changing</li>
	<li>Hit enter, last step is to type git push origin main, this pushes all of your changes into github</li>
</ol>
<p>To check all of the changes you made, use the git status command. It shows what is pushed into the github repository and hat you need to push.</p>
